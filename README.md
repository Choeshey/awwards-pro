# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

React.js, Tailwind CSS, and GSAP together create powerful, interactive, and visually appealing websites. React.js handles the component-based structure, enabling reusable, maintainable, and fast UIs. Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling, making it easy to build responsive and customizable designs without writing lengthy CSS. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) adds smooth, high-performance animations and transitions, bringing pages to life with scrolling effects, element reveals, and interactive motion. This stack is ideal for creating modern landing pages, portfolios, or dynamic dashboards that stand out. By combining React’s flexibility, Tailwind’s efficiency, and GSAP’s animation capabilities, developers can deliver engaging, responsive, and highly polished web experiences.
